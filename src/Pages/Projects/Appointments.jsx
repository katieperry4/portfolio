              This desktop application, built with WinForms and powered by MySQL, streamlines appointment management for users. 
              It enables adding, editing, and deleting customers and appointments while providing a comprehensive calendar view for daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. 
              The app includes built-in functionality to detect the user's location and timezone, offering localized features like a French-translated login page for users in France. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Scheduling is enhanced with intelligent checks to prevent overlapping appointments and ensure all bookings fall within business hours (9 AMâ€“5 PM EST), accounting for daylight saving time. 
              Additionally, users can generate detailed reports, including appointment types by month, user-specific schedules, and total appointments by day.
